# Ultimate Imposter: Social Deduction Game

A fun social deduction game built with Dioxus 0.7 where players try to find the imposter among them!

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Ultimate Imposter** is a mobile-friendly web game for 3+ players. One player is randomly assigned as the imposter with a different word, while all other players receive the same word. Through discussion and voting, players try to identify the imposter before they blend in successfully.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust installed on your system
- Dioxus CLI

### Installation

1. Install Dioxus CLI:
```bash
curl -sSL http://dioxus.dev/install.sh | sh
```

2. Run the game locally:
```bash
dx serve --platform web
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### 📱 Running on Mobile (Same Network)

To access the game from your mobile phone on the same WiFi network:

1. The app is already configured to bind to all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0:8080`)
2. Find your computer's local IP address:
   - **macOS/Linux**: `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1`
   - **Windows**: `ipconfig`
3. On your mobile device, open the browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8080
   ```
   Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8080`

This allows all players to use the same device or different devices on the network!

## 📱 How to Play

1. **Setup**: Enter the number of players (3+) and their names
2. **Category Selection**: Players choose a category for the round (e.g., "Food & Drinks 🍕", "Animals 🦁", etc.)
3. **Category Reveal**: Everyone sees the chosen category
4. **Card View**: Each player reveals their card privately (pass the device around)
5. **Discussion**: Players discuss to find who has the odd word
6. **Voting**: Group decides who to eliminate
7. **Scoring**: 
   - If imposter found: Civilians get 10 points each
   - If imposter not found: Imposter gets 20 points

## 📝 Word Categories

The game includes **20 categories** with over **400+ challenging word pairs**:

- 🍕 Food & Drinks (30 pairs)
- 🦁 Animals (30 pairs)
- 🌳 Nature (44 pairs)
- ⛅ Seasons & Weather (15 pairs)
- 🎵 Music & Arts (16 pairs)
- ⚽ Sports & Activities (18 pairs)
- 💻 Technology (22 pairs)
- 🚗 Transportation (19 pairs)

## 🛠️ Technology

- **Framework**: Dioxus 0.7
- **Language**: Rust
- **Styling**: Custom CSS
- **Persistence**: Browser localStorage + Optional server disk storage
- **Session Management**: UUID-based session IDs

## 💾 Game Persistence & Session Management

Ultimate Imposter features automatic game state persistence that allows you to resume your game seamlessly after browser refresh, closing tabs, or even restarting your device.

### ✨ How It Works

**Automatic Save:**
- Game state is saved to your browser's localStorage automatically on every action
- No manual save button needed - everything happens in the background
- Works completely offline, no server required

**What Gets Saved:**
- ✅ Player names and scores
- ✅ Current game screen (Setup, CardView, Voting, etc.)
- ✅ Round number and card assignments
- ✅ Elimination status and imposter identity
- ✅ All game progress

**Session ID:**
- Each game session gets a unique UUID stored in localStorage
- Session ID persists across browser restarts
- Session ID is used internally to save/load game state
- Not displayed on screen to keep UI clean

### 🔄 Resume Game

**Single Device:**
1. Simply refresh the page or close/reopen the browser
2. The game automatically loads your last state
3. Continue playing from exactly where you left off

**Multiple Devices (Same Network):**
1. Game state is saved to each device's localStorage independently
2. To share a game session, you would need to export/import the session manually
3. For true cross-device sync, enable server mode (see below)

### 🗑️ Start Fresh Game

**Option 1:** Click the "New Game" button in the game (recommended)

**Option 2:** Clear browser data manually:
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
localStorage.clear();
// Then refresh the page
```

### 🔧 Technical Details

**Browser Storage:**
- Uses browser localStorage API
- Storage key: `ultimate_imposter_game_{session-id}`
- Session key: `ultimate_imposter_session_id`
- Data format: JSON serialized game state

**Data Structure:**
```rust
{
  session_id: String,
  game_screen: GameScreen,
  players: Vec<Player>,
  round_number: i32,
  cards: Vec<GameCard>,
  imposter_index: usize,
  // ... and more
}
```

**Privacy:**
- All data stays in your browser
- No data sent to external servers
- No tracking or analytics
- Completely offline-capable

### 🖥️ Server Disk Persistence (Optional)

For advanced users, server-side persistence can be enabled:

**Enable Server Mode:**
```bash
# Build with server feature
cargo build --features server

# Run fullstack mode
dx serve --features server
```

**Server Storage:**
- Game saves stored in `game_saves/` directory
- One JSON file per session: `{session-id}.json`
- Allows true cross-device synchronization
- Survives server restarts

**Server Functions Available:**
- `save_game_to_disk()` - Save game state to server
- `load_game_from_disk()` - Load game state from server
- `list_saved_games()` - List all saved sessions
- `delete_saved_game()` - Remove a saved session

**Note:** Server persistence requires uncommenting server functions in `src/views/game.rs` (lines marked with comments)

### 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **localStorage Only:** By default, all data stays in your browser
- **No External Calls:** No analytics, tracking, or external API calls
- **Random Session IDs:** Cryptographically secure UUID generation
- **Local-First:** Works 100% offline without any server

### 💡 Best Practices

1. **Regular Play:** Just play normally - saving is automatic
2. **New Session:** Always use "New Game" button for clean state
3. **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure localStorage is enabled (default in all modern browsers)
4. **Privacy:** All data stays in your browser, nothing is sent to external servers

```

**View logs:**
```bash
docker logs ultimate-imposter-app
```

**Stop the container:**
```bash
docker stop ultimate-imposter-app
```

**Remove the container:**

```

### Docker Compose (Optional)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  ultimate-imposter:
    build: .
    container_name: ultimate-imposter-app
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--quiet", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost/"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 5s
```

**Run with Docker Compose:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Stop with Docker Compose:**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployment on cloud platforms:

**Deploy to DigitalOcean, AWS, or any VPS:**
1. SSH into your server
2. Install Docker: `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sh get-docker.sh`
3. Clone your repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ultimate-imposter.git`
4. Build and run: `cd ultimate-imposter && docker build -t ultimate-imposter . && docker run -d -p 80:80 ultimate-imposter`

**Deploy to Fly.io:**
```bash
# Install Fly CLI
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Login to Fly
fly auth login

# Launch app (first time)
fly launch

# Deploy updates
fly deploy
```

**Deploy to Railway:**
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Railway will auto-detect the Dockerfile
3. Deploy automatically on git push

### Dockerfile Architecture

The Dockerfile uses a **multi-stage build** for optimal size and performance:

1. **Builder Stage:** Uses Rust image to compile the Dioxus app
2. **Production Stage:** Uses nginx:alpine to serve static files (only ~50MB!)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Small final image (~50MB vs ~2GB)
- ✅ Fast startup and low resource usage
- ✅ Production-ready nginx configuration
- ✅ Gzip compression enabled
- ✅ Health checks included
- ✅ Optimized for web serving

### Customizing nginx

To customize the nginx configuration, create an `nginx.conf` file and modify the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Add this line before the EXPOSE command
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```
